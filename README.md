spotifyrandomplaylist.com

The purpose of this website is to allow spotify users to experiment with different types of music. By generating a playlist of random songs with no preference for genre, users will be exposed to a wide variety of music and may find new music genres that they would be interested in. On the homepage users can browse through a set of random tracks and play their previews, this allows users to sample different songs and check if they fit their music profile. If a user wants to generate a playlist of random tracks, the web app will utilize the Spotify Web API to create a playlist on the users spotify account.

Technical info:

Website that uses the django and the spotify web api to allow users to create a playlist of random songs on spotify. Playlists are created by randomly selecting tracks from a database of over 2 million spotify api track ids. The database will always update itself with new tracks when ever a user creates a playlist. There is also a page that allows users to listen to a 30 second preview of the random tracks by hovering over the tracks album image. This option is only available on tracks that have a preview and the hovering to play option only works on google chrome.
