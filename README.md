spotifyrandomplaylist.com

Website that uses the django and the spotify web api to allow users to create a playlist of random songs on spotify. Playlists are created by randomly selecting tracks from a database of over 2 million spotify api track ids. The database will always update itself with new tracks when ever a user creates a playlist. There is also a page that allows users to listen to a 30 second preview of the random tracks by hovering over the tracks album image. This option is only available on tracks that have a preview and the hovering to play option only works on google chrome.
